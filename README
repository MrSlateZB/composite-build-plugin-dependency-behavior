This is a copy of the "Composite Builds Plugin Development Sample" from Gradle 6.5.1.

You should be able to run "gradlew greeting" and see "Hi Bob!" as output. 

This project differs from the sample in that I added a dependency to the greeting-plugin that is NOT present on the "gradlePluginPortal()" repository. It appears the buildscript using the plugin is trying to find the dependency for the plugin in use. 

If you uncomment line 7 (specifying the jitpack.io repository), the task will be able to run.
